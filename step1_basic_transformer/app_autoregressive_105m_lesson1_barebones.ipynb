    "# Introduction to the Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook, where we will explore the inner workings of the revolutionary Transformer Architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Originally introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, transformers have become a cornerstone of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have found applications in a myriad of other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer model, with its self-attention mechanism, is adept at handling sequences, making it perfect for tasks like translation, text generation, and more. Unlike recurrent models, transformers do not process data in order, which allows them to be more parallelizable and thus, faster to train on modern hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, our goal is to demystify the underlying components of the transformer architecture, specifically focusing on an autoregressive setting. By building it from scratch, we aim to provide clarity on how each part contributes to the overall functioning of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will find one of the most complete documented code. My goal is to make sure you understand everything. We are not leaving any rock unturned here!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's what we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positional Encoding Class: Learn how transformers account for the order of data without inherently processing it sequentially.\n",
    "* Scaled Dot Product Class: Dive into the self-attention mechanism and see how different parts of a sequence attend to each other.\n",
    "* Attention Head Class: Understand the fundamental building block of the self-attention mechanism.\n",
    "* Multi-head Attention Class: Discover how transformers harness multiple attention heads to capture various features from the data.\n",
    "* Feed-forward Module Class: Delve into the feed-forward networks present within the transformer and their role.\n",
    "* Transformer Block Class: See how the various components come together to form a transformer block.\n",
    "* Transformer Model: Integrate the different classes to build the complete autoregressive transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a hands-on understanding of the transformer architecture's components and the knowledge to build upon it for various applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're a student, a researcher, or an enthusiast, this deep dive into transformers will equip you with the foundational knowledge to further explore the vast landscape of modern NLP.\n",

    "* Text Generation: Given a prompt or starting sequence, the model can generate subsequent tokens/words to produce coherent and contextually relevant text.\n",
    "* Filling in the Blanks: You can use it to predict missing words or tokens in a sentence.\n",
    "* Next Word Prediction: Predict the next word in a sentence.\n",
    "* Other NLP Tasks: With fine-tuning, the model can be adapted for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, etc., although that's not its primary design."

    "### Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism, particularly as implemented in the Transformer architecture, has been a pivotal development in the field of deep learning, especially for tasks like machine translation and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of the attention mechanism in general terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "Imagine you're translating a sentence from one language to another. While translating a particular word, you might want to focus on, or \"attend to\", one or a few specific words in the source sentence rather than the whole sentence. The attention mechanism allows a model to focus on different parts of the input data with different intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "The primary goal of attention is to capture contextual information. For a given word or token in a sequence, the attention mechanism computes its importance concerning other words in the sequence, thereby capturing the context in which the word appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attention Score\n",
    "The attention mechanism computes an \"attention score\" between input elements. This score typically represents how much focus a model should place on a particular input element when producing an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queries, Keys, and Values\n",
    "The Transformer represents input data as \"Queries\", \"Keys\", and \"Values\". For each input element, an attention score is computed by taking the dot product of its Query with all other Keys. The scores are then used to take a weighted sum of Values, which gives the output."

    "#### Scaled Dot Product\n",

    "\n",
    "*Checkout my post [A Simplified, Even 'Blasphemous' 👿 Explanation of the Transformer's Scaled Dot-Product Attention](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7102755952914784257?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) where I attempt to explain this function, which is at the core of the attention model used by the transformers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Transformer architecture, a specific kind of attention called \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" is used. Here, the attention scores are calculated using the dot product of the input vectors, and then they're scaled down (for stability reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function accepts three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* query: A matrix that, in the context of attention, seeks specific information.\n",
    "* key: A matrix that acts like a reference, helping match the appropriate parts of the input data to the queries.\n",
    "* value: A matrix holding the actual data/content that the attention mechanism will use to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the context of the Transformer model, these matrices come from the input embeddings, and they play specific roles in determining which parts of the input data the model should focus on (i.e., attend to).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function starts by determining the size or depth of the query matrix. This size, particularly of its last dimension, represents the depth or size of the key vectors. Given the architecture of the Transformer, it's common for the query, key, and value matrices to have similar depth for their last dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, attention scores are computed by taking the dot product between the query and a transposed version of the key. This transposition ensures that the matrix multiplication provides the desired attention scores. These scores are then scaled down by dividing them by the square root of the depth of the key vectors. This scaling step is essential for the stability of the model during training, preventing the scores from becoming too large and causing gradient issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, the function computes attention weights by applying the softmax operation to the scaled scores. This operation converts the scores into a set of probabilities (weights) that sum up to 1. These weights essentially determine how much focus should be placed on different parts of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the function produces its output. It does this by taking a weighted sum of the value matrix using the attention weights. This results in an output that's a combination of the input data (from the value matrix) with emphasis placed according to the computed attention weights."

    "\n",
    "The number of instances corresponds to the number of attention heads. These instances are stored in the self.heads variable, which is a nn.ModuleList. This ensures that PyTorch treats each of these attention heads as separate sub-modules, correctly handling parameters and gradients.\n",

    "Finally, an output linear layer (self.output_linear) is defined. This layer will be used to transform the concatenated output from all attention heads to the desired output size.\n",

    "It starts by embedding input tokens and adding positional information, then processes this data through multiple Transformer blocks, and finally predicts the likelihood of each token being the next in the sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Upon initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Token Embeddings (self.wte)**: An embedding layer is created to convert each token from the input into a vector representation of specified embedding_dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positional Encodings (self.wpe)**: The PositionalEncoding module creates positional embeddings, ensuring the model accounts for the position or order of tokens in the sequence.\n",

    "* **Final Layer Normalization (self.ln_f)**: A layer normalization module is added to stabilize and normalize the outputs after processing through all Transformer blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output Head (self.lm_head)**: A linear layer that maps the Transformer's output back to the size of the vocabulary. This facilitates token prediction, essential for language modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### During the forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Token Embedding**: The input tokens are first converted into their respective vector representations using the token embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positional Encoding Addition**: To these embeddings, positional encodings are added, ensuring the model recognizes the position of each token within the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Processing through Transformer Blocks**: The enriched token representations sequentially pass through each Transformer block, undergoing attention mechanisms and feed-forward transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Final Layer Normalization**: After all blocks have processed the data, it undergoes a final layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Prediction:** The processed data is passed through the lm_head, producing the logits or raw predictions for each token in the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### These logits can be further processed to predict the next token in the sequence."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this Jupyter notebook, we've embarked on a comprehensive journey, discovering the intricate design of the autoregressive transformer, one of the pillars of modern natural language processing. By building it from scratch, we've gained an invaluable understanding, not just of its high-level operations, but of the nuanced mechanics that power each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "From token and positional embeddings to the multi-head attention mechanisms, and from the feed-forward networks to the very structure of the transformer blocks, we've delved deep into the heart of what makes transformers revolutionary. Our step-by-step approach, interspersed with code snippets, has offered a pragmatic perspective, enabling us to appreciate both the theoretical foundation and practical implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our exploration doesn't end here. This notebook is not just an endpoint but a springboard. Equipped with this foundational knowledge, there are numerous avenues to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimization and Fine-tuning: How can we optimize our transformer for specific tasks or datasets?\n",
    "* Model Variants: Delving into variants like BERT, GPT, and T5 to understand the evolution of transformer architectures.\n",
    "* Applications: Beyond language modeling, transformers have reshaped fields from image processing to bioinformatics. Exploring these realms can offer fascinating insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the autoregressive transformer from scratch has been similar to assembling a complex object. Each piece, a module or a function, has its unique role, and watching them come together to form a coherent, functioning model has been enlightening.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you step beyond this guide, remember that understanding the basics concepts is the way for innovation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my next eposides I will add more complexity to this notebook. Stay tunned for these additional steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dataset preprocessing\n",
    "2. The Training loop, a simple version\n",
    "3. The Training loop, a more robust version. Here we build on the previous understanding of the basic training loop and add lots of additional sophistication like learning rate schedule, checkpoints, validation loop, and much more.\n",
    "4. The inference loop, a simple version\n",
    "5. The inference loop, a more robust version. Here we build on the previous understanding of the generation and add 'temperature', 'top_k', 'top_p' to the inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding and exploring!"
